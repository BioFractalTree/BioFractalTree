BioFractalTree
==============

 Bio-Fractal Tree Generator builds branching tube structures
 in recursive fractal fashion, with these properties:
   - it is non-self-overlapping.
   - multiple root/branch structures (bio-networks) can be
     generated in the same space and will not overlap with
     each other.
   - trees / bio-networks can be generated inside pre-defined
     (non-manifold geometric model) boundaries in a space-filling way
   - multi-threaded "compete" model for sub-branch generation
   - nearest-neighbor mapping for space-filling collision detection
